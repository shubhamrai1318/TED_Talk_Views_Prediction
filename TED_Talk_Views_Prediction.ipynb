        "TED is an unprofitable organisation that post videos online in Free. TED is devoted to spreading powerful ideas on just about any topic. These datasets contain over 4,000+ TED talks including transcripts in many languages. It was basically started as a conference in 1984 that designed by Richard saul wurman but due to some reasons it was unsuccesful. After 6 years in 1990 ,it back with a bang. In TED, speaker share their views and ideas to the society in 18 minutes. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan, and Bill Gates.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the number of views that a TED Talk video is likely to receive. By leveraging various features and characteristics of TED Talks, we aim to create a reliable model that can accurately forecast the popularity of these talks.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, we will gather a dataset containing information about various TED Talks, such as the speaker's background, the topic of the talk, the duration, the number of languages it is available in, and other relevant attributes. Additionally, we will include information on the number of views each TED Talk has received as the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project will involve several key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Collection:** We will collect a comprehensive dataset containing TED Talk information, including both descriptive features and the corresponding number of views.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Preprocessing:** The collected data will undergo preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for model training and evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feature Engineering:** We will explore and engineer additional relevant features from the existing dataset. This could involve extracting insights from the talk's title, speaker's profession, or incorporating external data sources to enhance the predictive power of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Selection:** We will evaluate and compare different regression models suitable for predicting the number of views. This may include algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Training and Evaluation:** The selected model will be trained on the prepared dataset and assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared. We will employ techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hyperparameter Tuning:** We will optimize the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or randomized search to improve its performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Model Deployment:** Once the best-performing model is identified, it will be deployed to make predictions on new and unseen TED Talks. The model will be packaged into a user-friendly interface where users can input the necessary information about a talk, and it will provide an estimate of the expected number of views.\n",
        "\n",
        "By accurately predicting the number of views for TED Talks, this project aims to provide valuable insights to content creators, speakers, and event organizers. It can help them understand the factors that contribute to a talk's popularity and optimize their content strategy accordingly.\n",
